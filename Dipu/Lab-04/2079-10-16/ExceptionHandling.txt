Exception Handling:
Exception Handling is the process of handling errors and exceptions in such a way
that they do not hinder normal execution of the system
Example:
User divides a number by zero this compile successfully but on run time error occurs.
To avoid this we will introduce exception handling techniques.
Error Handling is done using three keywords.
1.try
2.catch
3.throw
Syntax:
try{
    //code
    throw parameter;
    }
    catch(exception_name ex ){
        //code to handle exceptions
    }
